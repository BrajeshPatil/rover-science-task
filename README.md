# Rover Science Task
Module designed for in-situ soil testing directly on the rover.

# Overview
Vishwa, Vjti participated in the International Rover Challenge 2023. The rover primarily was supposed to perform four tasks: 
1. Science Task: The rover has to collect samples, perform analysis and seek signs of life.
2. Reconnaissance and Delivery Operation: The rover reconnaissance an area to search, locate, pick up, and deliver objects to specific locations.
3. Instrument Deployment and Maintenance Operation: The rover has to operate on a mock-up instrument panel to perform a set of precise operations.
4. Autonomous Mission: The rover is required to traverse between markers across moderately rugged terrain autonomously using arrow signs.

This repository primarily provides hardware designs and code samples for the **Science Task**.

# About the project
**Requirements of the Science Module:**
- Sample Collection:
  - Collect three soil samples:
    1. Two samples tested directly on the rover.
    2. One sample returned to the base station untouched.
  - Samples must be collected from at least 10 cm below the surface.
- Analysis:
  - Conduct tests on both soil and atmosphere.

**Component placement:**
- Position 1: Nema17 stepper motor placed under the marked area in the left-hand side (LHS) image.
- Position 2: Drill motor with a 3D-printed drill attached.
- Position 3: Behind the actuator lies the Arduino MEGA with the shield. Components on the PCB include:
  - A4988 Stepper Motor Driver
  - BMP180
  - DHT22
- Other Sensors:
  - SHT20 and MQ135 are placed inside white containers for gas detection (post-reaction) and soil temperature and humidity testing.
- Position 4: L298N motor drivers.
- Position 5: Actuator.
- MLX90614: Infrared temperature sensor placed below the box, pointing towards the ground.
- Chemical Storage and Pumping:
  - The right-hand side (RHS) image shows chemical containers and solenoid valves for pumping chemicals as needed.

**Working**
1. Site Identification:
    - The MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor scans the ground for sudden changes in temperature.
    - If significant temperature changes are detected, the site is selected for testing.
2. Soil Collection:
    - The actuator moves downward while the drill rotates clockwise, digging into the ground.
    - Soil samples settle on the steps of the drill.
    - Once the sample is collected, the actuator moves upwards, keeping the drill stationary.
    - The stepper motor ensures the testing container is positioned directly beneath the drill.
3. Soil Transfer:
    - The drill rotates counter-clockwise to release soil into the testing containers.
4. Chemical Testing:
    - Chemicals are added to the soil.
    - If methane gas is detected (via the MQ135 sensor), the presence of life can be inferred.
5. Repetition:
    - The above procedure is repeated for a second site to test another soil sample in a new container.
6. Sample Return:
    - For the third location, the soil is collected without testing and returned to the base station untouched.
