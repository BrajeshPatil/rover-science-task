# Science Task PCB
To address the need for simultaneous operation of multiple sensors and electro-mechanical components in the Science Task, we designed a custom shield compatible with the Arduino Mega 2560. The shield simplifies wiring by neatly integrating the connections and ensuring a clean and reliable setup.
This shield enables interfacing with a variety of sensors, including:
- BMP180 (Barometric Pressure and Temperature Sensor)
- MLX90614 (Infrared Temperature Sensor)
- DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor)
- SHT20 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor)
- MQ135 (Gas Sensor for Air Quality)
- HX711 (Load Cell Amplifier)
Additionally, the shield provides interfaces for:
- A4988 stepper motor driver for controlling the NEMA17 stepper motor.
- L298N motor driver for operating the actuator and drill motors.
By integrating these components onto a single shield, the design simplifies the connections, enhances reliability, and ensures compatibility with the Arduino Mega 2560.
